        #region Difference between Await and Join
        /*
         Blocking (Synchronous waiting): (join)

            Meaning: You stop the current thread and wait for something to finish.

            Thread Usage: The thread is stuck doing nothing ‚Äî just waiting.

            Efficiency: Wasteful ‚Äî thread is idle (just standing there).

            Effect on UI apps: Freezes the app ‚Äî users can‚Äôt click, move window, etc.


        Non-Blocking (Asynchronous waiting): (await)

            Meaning: You let the current thread do other work while waiting for something to finish.

            Thread Usage: The thread is free to continue doing other tasks (like keeping the UI responsive).

            Efficiency: Efficient ‚Äî thread can serve other requests or update the UI.

            Effect on UI apps: Keeps app smooth ‚Äî users can interact while waiting.


        Real Life Example üõí

            Blocking (Join):
            Imagine you are at a coffee shop.
            You order a coffee, and you just stand there doing nothing until the coffee is ready. (Wasting time.)

            Non-Blocking (Await):
            You order a coffee, they give you a buzzer.
            You go sit, chat, work, relax.
            When the coffee is ready, the buzzer calls you back. (Much better.)

        #region Diff Between Thread VS Task

        /*
        Can return a value?

        Task: ‚úÖ Yes, using Task<T>

        Thread: ‚ùå No, thread method must be void

        --------------------------

        üß† Passing Parameters

        Task:
        ‚úÖ Directly pass parameters via lambda:
        Task.Run(() => Myfun(value));

        Thread (lambda):
        ‚úÖ Also direct via lambda:
        new Thread(() => Myfun(value)).Start();

        --------------------------

        Can be awaited?

        Task: ‚úÖ Yes (await Task) or .Result() --> async waiting (non-blocking)

        Thread: ‚ùå No (use join) --> sync (blocking)

        --------------------------

        Exception handling

        Task: ‚úÖ Easy ‚Äî exceptions are captured and re-thrown when you await

        Thread: ‚ùå Hard ‚Äî must catch manually inside the thread

        --------------------------

        Efficiency

        Task: ‚úÖ Reuses threads from the ThreadPool ‚Äî lightweight

        Thread: ‚ùå Creates a new OS thread ‚Äî heavier on resources


        --------------------------

        Cancellation

        Task: ‚úÖ Supports cancellation with CancellationToken

        Thread: ‚ùå No built-in cancellation ‚Äî you have to code it yourself

        --------------------------

        Scheduling

        Task: ‚úÖ Managed by the .net runtime

        Thread: ‚ùå You manually manage starting, sleeping, and stopping

        --------------------------

        Parallelism

        Task: ‚úÖ Easily parallelize tasks with Task.Run, Task.WhenAll, etc.

        Thread: ‚ùå More complicated to coordinate multiple threads

        --------------------------

        Best for

        Task: Short-running or asynchronous operations

        Thread: Long-running or low-level control (timing, thread affinity, etc.)
